Dash web app to explore histroical events in relation to each other. Maybe this lets me finally remember some of the roman emperors.

## Desired features

* Staggered view, where events from the same category are layed out to use available space more efficiently
* Button to show similar events 
* Automatically retrieve events from web APIs
